Usage:<br/>
   &gt;at &lt;room-name&gt;|&lt;unit-path&gt; &lt;command&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This wiz-command allows you to execute commands, as if you were at the location<br/>
itself. You must give the location name, or unit-path as to where you want to<br/>
execute the command. After you have executed the command, you are moved back to<br/>
the room you came from, thus making 'at board goto temple' make no difference.<br/>
